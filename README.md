2Captcha.com's API used for solving Google's Invisible Recaptcha and Recaptcha v2 with Java Selenium Chrome Browser Test Automation.

  - Should solve image challenges
  - Should retry  for image challenges

  - Should response to invisible captcha forms
  
Google has a demo website that includes a dummy form. This example has been tested on this demo website. url without querystring will show I am not robot. You should add "?invisible=true" at the end of the following url. When invisible=true there will be an extra request to 2captcha.com for resolution of the invisible captcha. This repository is compatible with all Google Recaptcha types.
